NAME
     modflow-lgr - MODFLOW with Local Grid Refinement

ABSTRACT

     MODFLOW is a three-dimensional finite-difference ground-
     water model that was first published in 1984.  It has a modular
     structure that allows it to be easily modified to adapt the
     code for a particular application.  Many new capabilities have
     been added to the original model.  Mehl and Hill (2005) document
     an enhancement to MODFLOW, which is called Local Grid Refinement
     (LGR).  The combined code is called MODFLOW-LGR.  MODFLOW-LGR
     allows a small part of a larger model domain to be refined
     without refining the entire model.


HISTORY

      MODFLOW-LGR Version 1.1.02 06/18/2009 - Fixed a bug that caused the 
         program to halt with a message indicating incorrect vertical 
         grid alignment when the grids were aligned correctly.
         This version is based on MODFLOW-2005 release 1.6.02.

      MODFLOW-LGR Version 1.1.1 04/15/2008 - Fixed a bug that caused
         incorrect printing of head at the location of maximum head 
         change in simulations with multiple children.

      MODFLOW-LGR Version 1.1 07/15/2007 - Added support for multiple
         non-overlapping child grids.

      MODFLOW-LGR Version 1.0 03/01/2006 - Initial release.


DATA REQUIREMENTS
     In order to use the LGR capability in MODFLOW-LGR, two model
     datasets are required.  The first dataset defines the larger
     model domain, and the second defines the smaller part to be
     refined.


SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

     MODFLOW-LGR is written primarily in Fortran 90. Only the GMG
     solver package is written in C.  The code has been used on
     UNIX-based computers and personal computers running various
     forms of the Microsoft Windows operating system.
